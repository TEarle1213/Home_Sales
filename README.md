## Technologies
  Python, Spark, AWS, SQL, Parquet

## Resources
 Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC
 
 ## Purpose
 Utilize PySpark to analyze home sales data hosted on the AWS cloud. Show benefits of of partitioning and parquet formatting in reduced run times and lowered resource usage. Answer business requests using SparkSQL. 
  
 ## Analysis & Reporting
  - Answered questions about home prices using SparkSQL.
  - Included timer in coding for a query.
  - Created cached table and ran timer on same query to compare run times.
  - Used partitioning and parquet formatting on data and ran timer on same query.
  - Results of timers are: .58 seconds for the original query, .63 seconds on the cached table and .59 seconds on the partitioned data. This clearly shows the benefits of utilizing methods like caching, partitioning and parquet's columnar formatting to query data. Usage of these methods on Big Data would result in considerable business gains in the areas of time and resource utilization.
